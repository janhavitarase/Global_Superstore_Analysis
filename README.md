The global superstore dashboard consists of various visuals to quickly understand the data and highlight vital information to enable users to make quick and better decisions. This dashboard contains cards, pie charts and bar charts which provides detailed analyses of information on store sales and a quick summary table to give sales & profit distribution details in various sub-categories.

OBSERVATIONS :

❖ As we can see,the summary table is showing copiers are the most profitable and the phone is the best selling sub-category.

❖ Pie chart shows the home office segment has very low sales as compared to the consumer segment, therefore the marketing team needs to focus more on home office segment products.

❖ Bar charts are showing the top 5 products and states by profit. The most profitable country is the United-states and the most profitable product is copiers.
